GeoServer requires a *Java 7* runtime to be installed on your system. For more information about Java and GeoServer please see the section on :ref:`java`.

There are a few ways to install GeoServer on Windows.  The simplest way is to use the Windows installer, but you can also perform a manual installation with the OS-independent binary.

.. note:: To run GeoServer as part of a servlet container such as Tomcat, please see the :ref:`installation_war` section.
