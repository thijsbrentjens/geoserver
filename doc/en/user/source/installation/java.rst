Java Runtime Environment
========================

GeoServer **requires Java 7** (also known as JRE 1.7):

* Java 7 - GeoServer 2.6.x and above (OpenJDK and Oracle JRE tested)

JREs other than those tested may work correctly, but are generally not recommended.  As an example users of OpenJDK 1.6 report GeoServer 2.5 to be working with reduced 2D rendering performance.

Unsupported:

* Java 8 - Unsupported with known issues (did not build for the last volunteer to try)

Archived:

* Java 6 - Required for GeoServer 2.3.x to GeoServer 2.5.x (Oracle JRE tested)
* Java 5 - Required for GeoServer 2.2.x and earlier (Sun JRE tested)
  
As of GeoServer 2.0, a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is sufficient to run GeoServer.  GeoServer no longer requires a Java Development Kit (JDK).
